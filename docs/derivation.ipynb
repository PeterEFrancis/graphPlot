    "### A Motivation In Graph Theory\n",
    "**Definition 1** Given a set $\\mathcal{W}$, a *graph* $G$ is a proper subset of the Cartesian product, $\\mathcal{W}\\times \\mathcal{W}$, such that for any $(A,B)\\in G$, it is true that $A\\neq B$ and $(B,A)\\in G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Example 2**<br>\n",
    "Let $\\mathcal{W}=\\{0,1,2,3\\}$. Then $$G=\\{(0,1),(1,0),(0,2),(2,0),(1,2),(2,1),(1,3),(3,1)\\} \\subset \\mathcal{W}\\times \\mathcal{W}$$ is a graph.\n",
    "Since the standard notation for $G$ is redudent, we will remove every symmetric element:\n",
    "$$G=\\{(0,1),(0,2),(1,2),(1,3)\\}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can have a visual representation of graphs in the plane by drawing labeled vertices and connecting them according to the connections in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Example 2 (continued)**<br>\n",
    "The graph $G$ can be drawn in the plane as\n",

    "> \n",
    ">![](img/e2.png).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> which is obviously not ideal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 3** A graph is *planar* if it can be plotted in the plane with no intersecting edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that many planar graphs <u>can</u> be plotted with interesecting edges, and unfortunately, not every graph is planar.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Example 4**<br>\n",
    "The $K_5$ graph is not planar:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">![](img/k5.png)\n",
    ">\n",
    "> There is no way to rearrange the nodes in the $K_5$ so that no two edges cross.\n",

    "Nothing about a graph definition (a set of tuples) defines how to plot the nodes of a graph, so we might consider asking is: ***How can we efficiently plot graphs in a visually satisfactory way?*** If A graph is planar, how can we plot it to reflect that structure? If a graph is not planar, what is the most flattering way we can play the nodes? We will assume that the graph has no self-connecting nodes, since if it does, it will not change how we should place nodes.\n",

    "### Intuitive Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "One intuitive path to take, is to use physicial phenomenon to move the nodes into an optimal place.\n",

    "Recall some governing force equations that will be useful:\n",

    " - Electrostatic Force $$F_e=Q\\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}$$\n",
    "<!--  - Gravitational Force $$F_g=mg$$ -->\n",
    "\n",
    "The nodes can be modeled as charged particles, and the connections as springs. In this sense, starting from random positions the nodes will have the freedom to equalize and spread out, but be constrained by the edge connections. \n",
    "<!-- As the nodes move around and equlize, the gravitational force can help to ensure that the graph in whole stays in the same place. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the general idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/flow_diagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So how should we define $q$ and $m$? Intuitively, we want the vertices to be more \"free\" the less connected they are, and when a node is very connected, we want it to have more inertia. Luckily, there is already convemtional notation for this!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 5** The *degree* of node $A$ in a graph $G$ is the number of nodes that are connected to $A$, and is notated $\\text{deg}(A)$. \n",
